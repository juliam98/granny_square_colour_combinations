# Granny square colour combinations

This code generates all possible colour combinations for crocheting granny squares. 

## How to use it
Simply swap the colour names and RGB values in the code to colours of the yarn you are planning to use for your granny squares.

By default the script will generate sqares with non-rerpeating colours, but if you want to generate combinations *with* repetitions set the `repeat` variable to `"Y"`.

**Number of colours**: The current version of the code generates images of granny squares which consist of four squares. Therefore provide at least four colours to generate the combinations (if non-repeating). 

## Output:
The output are images representing the possible colour combinations for your granny squares.
